      "“[The INFIN] immediately identified the healthy and high performing teams, comfortable with task conflict, versus the dysfunctional and ineffective teams unable to withstand constructive feedback. Healthy and high performing teams were able to eliminate ambiguity and subjectivity in recognizing and rewarding each other's contributions. The INFIN provided us with a transparent and fair system for acknowledging the hard work and dedication of our colleagues and a way to willingly discuss weaknesses as individuals and as a team.”",
